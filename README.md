This project applies supervised machine learning techniques to perform classification, where the goal is to predict categorical labels (e.g., "spam" or "not spam", "low risk" vs "high risk") based on input features.

We use scikit-learn's MLPClassifier and other models to train and evaluate performance using accuracy and other classification metrics.
